</div>

A curated collection of AI-powered slash commands for code review, problem analysis, and refactoring workflows.

## Quick Reference

📋 `/plan-review` - Review implementation plans  
🔍 `/code-review-low` - Fast code review  
🔬 `/code-review-high` - Thorough code review  
🐛 `/problem-analyzer` - Identify bugs and affected files  
♻️ `/refactor-code` - Start refactoring workflows  
🔌 `/kill-port` - Kill processes running on specific ports  
🔎 `/research-better-lib` - Find modern, faster library alternatives  

## Installation

### Cursor
Copy the `.md` files from the `slash-commands/` directory into `.cursor/commands/` directory. Remove the `$1` parameters and XML wrapping tags when using in Cursor.

**Official docs**: [Cursor Slash Commands](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/slash-commands)

### Codex
Copy the `.md` files from the `slash-commands/` directory into `~/.codex/prompts/` directory. Restart Codex after installation for changes to take effect.

**Official docs**: [Codex Prompts](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/prompts.md)

### Claude Code
Claude Code supports both project-specific and personal commands:

**Project commands** (shared with team):
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
# Copy the .md files to .claude/commands/
```

**Personal commands** (available across all projects):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
# Copy the .md files to ~/.claude/commands/
```

## Commands

### 1. `plan-review`
Reviews implementation plans and provides a go/no-go decision for development. Evaluates:
- Codebase alignment and current patterns
- Scope clarity and completeness
- Performance, security, and privacy impact
- Code smells and potential caveats

**Usage**: `/plan-review "<your-plan>"`

**Examples**:
```
/plan-review "We're planning to implement plan @task-x-new-cool-feature.md"

/plan-review "Here is the plan we want to implement: @my-plan.md"
```

### 2. `code-review-low` & `code-review-high`
Comprehensive code review commands for post-implementation analysis.

**`code-review-low`**: Fast review focusing on critical issues
- Code smells and security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Essential test coverage

**`code-review-high`**: Thorough review with extended analysis
- All `code-review-low` checks plus additional validations
- Deeper security and performance analysis
- Comprehensive test recommendations

**Usage**: `/code-review-low "<files/code/description to review>"`

**Examples**:

```
/code-review-low "my plan @task-x-cool-feature has been implemented check unstaged files for review"

/code-review-low "@auth.server.ts @auth.rs @auth.connector.ts"
```

### 3. `problem-analyzer`
Identifies bugs and maps affected files across the codebase. Provides:
- Root cause analysis
- File impact assessment
- Minimal safe fix proposals
- Documentation gap identification

**Usage**: `/problem-analyzer "<problem-description>"`

**Examples:**
The Problem analyzer prompt works best when you add logs and a short problem description.

I ran this often with cheeta model to get a quick analysis and move over to gpt codex.

```
/problem-analyzer "the app won't compile. here are the logs <paste-logs>"

/problem-analyzer "we have a serious blocking bug in @user-form.ts and @user.service.ts"
```

### 4. `refactor-code`
Initiates refactoring workflows with clear scope and isolation:
- Feature-specific refactoring
- Commit isolation guidelines
- Documentation of unrelated issues (without fixing)
- No backward compatibility or feature flags

**Usage**: `/refactor-code "<refactoring-goal>"`

```
/refactor-code "here is our implementation plan @impl-plan lets start"
```

### 5. `kill-port`
Kills processes running on specified ports with OS-specific commands and safety checks:
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Process identification and verification
- Safety warnings for system processes
- Graceful shutdown recommendations

**Usage**: `/kill-port "<port-number(s)>"`

**Examples**:
```
/kill-port "3000"

/kill-port "3000 8080 9000"
```

### 6. `research-better-lib`
A comprehensive template for evaluating alternatives to baseline libraries. Helps find modern, faster JavaScript/TypeScript libraries that outperform existing solutions in latency and bundle size while maintaining or improving relevance/quality.

**Features**:
- Structured problem statement and success metrics
- Search query templates for benchmarking
- Candidate library shortlist evaluation
- Minimal benchmark design guidelines
- Decision rubric and deliverables checklist

**Usage**: `/research-better-lib "<baseline-library> <domain/use-case> <candidate-libraries>"`

**Examples**:
```
/research-better-lib "Fuse.js fuzzy search fuzzysort quick-score FlexSearch MiniSearch"

/research-better-lib "lodash utility functions ramda remeda"
```

## Workflow Tips

- Use `code-review-low` after implementing features for quick validation
- Use `code-review-high` for major changes or before releases
- Combine `problem-analyzer` with debugging sessions for faster issue resolution
- Use `plan-review` before starting complex implementations
